Some quick experimentation in various languages to evaluate language performance

## Language Evaluation Task
1. Fetch a page from the lodestone
2. Scrape the result of the page for name
3. Return result
4. Time performance in ms
5. Ensure concurrency/asynchronous execution is occuring
6. Record results
7. Repeat 1-6 10000 times

## Database evaluation task
1. Setup an EC2 instance
2. Import the entire May census into the database
3. Execute 5 count queries (TBD) against the database
4. Time performance in ms
